## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software project. It serves as the foundation upon which the entire system is built.

Purpose and Importance
The main goal of requirement analysis is to ensure that all stakeholders—such as clients, users, business analysts, and developers—have a clear and shared understanding of the software's expectations and objectives. This phase reduces ambiguity and lays the groundwork for designing, developing, and delivering a product that meets user needs.

Key Activities Involved
Elicitation – Gathering requirements through interviews, questionnaires, observations, and workshops.

Analysis – Refining and organizing requirements, resolving conflicts, and checking for feasibility and clarity.

Documentation – Creating formal requirement specifications, such as the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.

Validation – Ensuring that requirements are complete, consistent, and aligned with business goals.

Why It Matters in the SDLC
Improves clarity: Prevents misunderstandings by ensuring that requirements are clearly defined and agreed upon.

Reduces rework: Catching issues early minimizes costly changes later in the project.

Enhances planning: Enables more accurate estimates for time, cost, and resources.

Supports quality: Clear requirements help ensure that testing can be thorough and aligned with user expectations.

Conclusion
Requirement Analysis is a foundational activity that drives project success. Without it, teams risk building software that is misaligned with user needs, resulting in wasted time, money, and effort.
